Python 3.6.12 is required because that's what runs on the Jetson
and it's also the version of Python that `pyrealsense2` is built for.

Install `pyenv` (see their GitHub page for details)
and then install Python 3.6.12
`pyenv install 3.6.12`
`pyenv global 3.6.12` 
and then create a virtual env

then source activate it and then run
`python3 -m pytest -sv`
