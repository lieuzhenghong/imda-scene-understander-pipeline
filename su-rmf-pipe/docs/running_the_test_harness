Python 3.6.12 is required because that's what runs on the Jetson
and it's also the version of Python that `pyrealsense2` is built for.

Install `pyenv` (see their GitHub page for details)
and then install Python 3.6.12
`pyenv install 3.6.12`
`pyenv global 3.6.12` 
and then create a virtual env

then source activate it and then run
`python3 -m pytest -sv`

I now use a different command called coverage.
In the virtual environment,
```pip install coverage```.
Then `cd src` and run
```coverage run --source=. --omit="test*" -m pytest && coverage report```

You should see something like the following:
