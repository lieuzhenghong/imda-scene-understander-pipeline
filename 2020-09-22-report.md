Spent a lot of time trying to get my credentials. Had a lot of back and forth with Nandha.

I SSH into the EC2 instance by typing

`aws ssm start-session --target i-0b902614a4ae8cce4`

and from there I followed the instructions to install ROS2 and RMF Core.

I documented the process in a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/lieuzhenghong/966e5cc28de599dcf10afc9f25d32a71)
