So we figured out that my monitor was causing the problem,
(ergo I can't use the Jetson right now)
and while waiting for the new monitor to arrive,
I was tasked by Eric to look at how we can convert the Deepstream model
then

> Finally to output the results, DeepStream presents various options: render the output with the bounding boxes on the screen, save the output to the local disk, stream out over RTSP or just send the metadata to the cloud. For sending metadata to the cloud, DeepStream uses Gst-nvmsgconv and Gst-nvmsgbroker plugin. Gst-nvmsgconv converts the metadata into schema payload and Gst-msgbroker establishes the connection to the cloud and sends the telemetry data. There are several built-in broker protocols such as Kafka, MQTT, AMQP and Azure IoT. Custom broker adapters can be created.

So the priority now is to build and deploy _any_ Deepstream project on
the NVIDIA Jetson.
