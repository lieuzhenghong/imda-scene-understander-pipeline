SU1.0 --- modules related to Covid 19.

They deploy this on the card mounted to the robot.
They subscribe to the camera topic of the robot
Image from the camera
Get the result back and do the decision.
If they detected that someone is not wearing a mask,
then the robot might play a sound "Please wear a mask".

We have completed it but recently they found out some bad cases --- false negative or false positives.
So Xin Zheng is editing the model now

And now my job is to redeploy this model on the Jetson
because we need to be sure that it works correctly.

If I can independently replicate the installation process, this allows me to surface the gaps in the documentation.

I'm working on SU2.0 now and I have to plan the timeline.

Epic: **Build the Scene Understanding Manager**,
and deploy the Scene Understanding Model onto the Jetson

1. Deploy "Hello World" sample DeepStream model: 01--08 Oct
2. Build end-to-end sample Deepstream model: 09--15 Oct
3. Send the outputs of the model via RabbitMQ to the AWS EC2 instance: 19--23 Oct
4. Augment the model to perform best-effort 3D bounding polygon reconstruction: 30 Oct--06 Nov
5. Get the SU 2.0 detection model running on the Jetson: 09--13 Nov
6. Receive and process the RabbitMQ message and convert it into global coordinate frame: 16--20 Nov
7. Publish the 3D bounding boxes over ROS for use in e.g. fleet manager: 23--27 Nov

I learned Docker from Siyang:

Images versus Containers

How to build a docker image: something called a Dockerfile

A docker file must always be called Dockerfile

- `FROM python:3.7`: pull a base image to build on top of from Docker
- `COPY requirements.txt .`: copy `requirements.txt` to the home directory of the Docker image
- `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`: run any arbitrary Linux command
- `COPY . .`: copy all the source code into the image itself
- `WORKDIR /app`: sets the home directory of the Docker image - asked whether it's any different from `RUN cd /app`
- `ENTRYPOINT`: final command that you want to set to run the application.
  - `-u`: forces Python to print out stdout from Flask

**QUESTION**: when do we use `RUN`, and when do we use the other commands like
`WORKDIR` and `ENTRYPOINT`?

RUN commands are sequential steps to build the image and ENTRYPOINT is the last one.

`sudo docker build -t facedetection .`: build a Docker image called `facedetection`
with the Dockerfile in the current directory

`sudo docker run -d -p 5003:5003 --log-opt max-size=5m --log-opt-max-file=5 --restart always --name facedetection facedetection`

`--restart always`: this Docker container always restarts on crash/shutdown

- `-d`: Detached version of the container. In production you always run detached
  if not detached it won't run in the background, will run in your term session
- `-p 5003:5003`: If we run a Docker container, the port can't be accessed outside the Docker software
  So we need to expose a particular port to the outside world
  Always name the container name the image name if you don't run multiple containers of the same image
- `--log-opt-max-size`: maximum size of the log file

To show running containers, type `docker ps`

To remove a Docker container type `docker rm <container>`

To remove a Docker image type `docker rmi <image>`

**Docker caching**: Every line in Docker is a separate command
and is remembered by the Docker itself. It will know whether a certain file
has been changed etc.
It will go directly from that layer cache and install from there
Docker will skip lines if those lines are unchanged

**Takeaway**: it's very important to mutate Dockerfiles as late as possible
to reduce the work.
Docker remembers the state at every single line and
will only start running at the first mutated line

To remove trash (untagged) Docker images type `docker image prune`
To remove trash (untagged) Docker containers type `docker container prune`

To debug a Docker container:

`docker logs facedetection`

`docker exec -it facedetection bash`: We already have a running container
and so sometimes we encounter some error and we want to enter the container
to look at the source code using the Bash shell

If the source code crashes, the container will crash immediately --
to debug, do a sleep or try accept

To reduce the file size, use a `slim` image: `python:3.8-slim`
50MB vs 876MB

### Containers communicating with one another

Dockers need to be linked to the same network to communicate
We can either do it in the `docker run` command or using the `docker compose`

### Files are not persistent in Docker Containers

Once we remove the container everything is gone for good
We can use docker `volumes` to map particular files to particular machines
One very good example is to host a Docker database---of course we want the data
to persist.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows us to run multiple containers and specify the dependencies
between the containers
