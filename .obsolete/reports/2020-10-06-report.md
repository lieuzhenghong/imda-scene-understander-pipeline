This is **the** resource for developing DeepStream SDK plugins:
[resource](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_introduction.html)

The most important section is by far the
[GStreamer Plugin Details](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_details.html#)
subsection.

The two most important sample apps are
[DeepStream Test 4](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps/tree/master/apps/deepstream-test4)
where a h264 stream is sent out through the `NvMsgBroker`
and
[DeepStream Test 1 USB](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps/tree/master/apps/deepstream-test1-usbcam)
where USB webcam input is used for inference.

The
[Nvidia DeepStream SDK API Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/DeepStream_Development_Guide/baggage/index.html)
is also very important even though the damn thing is in C.

Also try to understand what `GstBuffer` is: the DeepStream SDK attaches the DeepStream metadata object,
`NvDSBatchmeta`, described in the following sections.

**What is the purpose of the metadata object?**

**Do I need to create my own metadata object?**

**What is the `pyds` module for? What does it do?**

It looks like `pyds` are Python bindings for the SDK Metadata library:

[**MetaData Access**](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream_Development_Guide/deepstream_Python_sample_apps.html)

DeepStream MetaData contains inference results and other information used in
analytics. The MetaData is attached to the Gst Buffer received by each pipeline
component. The metadata format is described in detail in the SDK MetaData
documentation and API Guide.

The SDK MetaData library is developed in C/C++. Python bindings provide access
to the MetaData from Python applications. The bindings are provided in a
compiled module, available for x86_64 and Jetson platforms. The pyds.so module
is available as part of the DeepStream SDK installation under /lib directory.

**String Access**

Allocators are available for the following structs:

```
NvDsVehicleObject: alloc_nvds_vehicle_object()
NvDsPersonObject:  alloc_nvds_person_object()
NvDsFaceObject:    alloc_nvds_face_object()
NvDsEventMsgMeta:  alloc_nvds_event_msg_meta()
NvDsEvent:         alloc_nvds_event()
NvDsPayload:       alloc_nvds_payload()
Generic buffer:    alloc_buffer(size)
```

**Pipeline**

"nvmsgconv" plugin uses NVDS_META_EVENT_MSG type of metadata from the buffer
and generates the "DeepStream Schema" payload in Json format. Static properties
of schema are read from configuration file in the form of key-value pair.
Check dstest4_msgconv_config.txt for reference. Generated payload is attached
as NVDS_META_PAYLOAD type metadata to the buffer.

"nvmsgbroker" plugin extracts NVDS_META_PAYLOAD type of metadata from the buffer
and sends that payload to the server using protocol adaptor APIs.

Generating custom metadata for different type of objects:
In addition to common fields provided in NvDsEventMsgMeta structure, user can
also create custom objects and attach to buffer as NVDS_META_EVENT_MSG metadata.
To do that NvDsEventMsgMeta provides "extMsg" and "extMsgSize" fields. User can
create custom structure, fill that structure and assign the pointer of that
structure as "extMsg" and set the "extMsgSize" accordingly.
If custom object contains fields that can't be simply mem copied then user should
also provide function to copy and free those objects.

Refer generate_event_msg_meta() to know how to use "extMsg" and "extMsgSize"
fields for custom objects and how to provide copy/free function and attach that
object to buffer as metadata.

NOTE: This app by default sends message for first object of every 30th frame. To
change the frequency of messages, modify the following line in source code accordingly.
if(is_first_object and not (frame_number%30)) should be changed to:
if (not (frame_number % 30)) to get all objects of a single frame
