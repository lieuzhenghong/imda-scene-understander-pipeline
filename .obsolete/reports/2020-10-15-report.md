Managed to get RabbitMQ working but the problem is that
I don't really understand what is going on.

What with the NvDSMeta and all that... really confusing.

Next order of business is to try to strip down the
sample code and run my own to make sure it works.

Then set up a non-localhost version to make sure that
messages can be passed through different IPs.
Maybe a Docker RabbitMQ server running on DO or something.
