When a ROS node advertises a topic, it provides a hostname:port combination (a URI) that other nodes will contact when they want to subscribe to that topic. It is important that the hostname that a node provides can be used by all other nodes to contact it. The ROS client libraries use the name that the machine reports to be its hostname. This is the name that is returned by the command hostname.

NO IDEA how to do port forwarding. Very annoying

Could use rosbridge suite instead of installing ROS2 on the NX card
