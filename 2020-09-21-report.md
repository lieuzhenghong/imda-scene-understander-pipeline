Today I spoke to Eric and Marcus and that was very helpful

## Client-side

I spoke to Marcus and the talk was very useful
Only after speaking to him did I find out that there is such a thing called the NX card
which is mounted on the robot and that's the one doing the machine learning,
not the robot itself.

So it's the NX card that also needs to have ROS2 installed.

1. Get access to the NX card
2. Install ROS2 on the NX card
3. Take the JSON objects that are coming in from the DL model and pipe them to the server using ROS2 publisher (write ROS2 publisher using Python)
